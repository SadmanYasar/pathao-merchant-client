## About

<table>
<tr>
<td>

This app was initially made for a business that gets orders from social network sites. Each order had to be copy pasted to the spreadsheet which was time consuming. With this app, it is easier to keep track of the orders and all the orders can be downloaded as a CSV file in one click which can be uploaded to the merchant panel.

Key features of **Pathao Merchant Client**:

- Search, add or delete a shipment
- Add, update or delete orders in a shipment
- Download the whole shipment data as a CSV file that can be uploaded to Pathao Merchant Panel
- Dark mode
